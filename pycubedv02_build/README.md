# build-files
PyCubed-specific files necessary to locally compile the CircuitPython firmware for the mainboard. See https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython for more details.

‚ùó NOTE: Pre-built firmware is available in the [firmware]() directory. These files are only necessary when wanting to alter low-level PyCubed firmware.
